On a machine with approximately 2GB of RAM, this library was able to spawn and
handle 350,000 qthreads. It may be able to do more, but swapping will become an
issue, and you may start to run out of address space. There is no theoretical
reason why this library could not work on a 64-bit machine. It may be possible
to shrink the stack size of qthreads even further (currently 8k), and thus
handle more threads. Currently, the only real limiting factor on the number of
threads is the amount of memory and address space you have available.
