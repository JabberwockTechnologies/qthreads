At the moment, the copyright of this software is yet to be determined.

HOWEVER, this contains parts of an earlier library (libtask, by Russ Cox) that
requires the propogation of its copyright information. This sofware is in the
osx_compat directory, namely the files:

	asm.S
	power-ucontext.h
	386-ucontext.h
	context.c
	taskimpl.h

The rest of the qthread library, which will function on any Unix system with
the makecontext()-family of functions, can stand alone. Those files are simply
implementations of the makecontext() family of functions for MacOS X, which
doesn't have them (as of OSX 10.4).

The libtask copyright is as follows:
