.SH DESCRIPTION
This function initializes a qdqueue distributed queue object. This distributed queue is locality aware, and as such prioritizes "nearby" data over the globally oldest data. It provides an end-to-end ordering guarantee: elements enqueued from any given location may not be consumed out of order by any other single location.
