On a machine with approximately 2GB of RAM, this library was able to spawn and
handle 350,000 qthreads. With some modifications (mostly in stack-size), it was
able to handle 1,000,000 qthreads. It may be able to do more, but swapping will
become an issue, and you may start to run out of address space.

This library has been tested, and runs well, on a 64-bit machine, with some
alignment concerns.

On many machines, the stack is required to be page-aligned and there are
usually strict requirements for the alignment of the ucontext_t structure
(particularly on a 64-bit machine). Thus, the stack and context generally take
at least 2 pages (8k). The stack can be limited even further (it has been
tested with a 2k stack on a 32-bit machine, which is how it handled 1,000,000
threads).

Currently, the only real limiting factor on the number of threads is the amount
of memory and address space you have available. For more than 2^32 threads, the
thread_id value will need to be made larger (or eliminated, as it is not
required by the library itself).
