.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Initializes the futurelib environment so that threads may create
future computations.
.PP
The argument, \fIvp_per_loc\fR, specifies how many futures may be active on
each location at a time. This does not include qthreads which were not created
as futures since futurelib is not aware of how many of these exists. Active
threads include all created futures which are currently running and have not
explicitly yielded. Inactive futures are not limited, as this could easily lead
to deadlock.
