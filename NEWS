--- 0.4 ---
New Features:
 - man pages for all major functions
 - added qthread_feb_status()

Improvements:
 - changed the qthread_f prototype to be easier to use
--- 0.3 ---
New Features:
 - added qthread_writeF(), which as the same arguments and effect as writeEF,
   but does not block
 - added qthread_prepare(), qthread_schedule(), and associated functions to
   decouple thread creation from thread scheduling

Improvements:
 - added information about compiling with the PGI compiler
 - added support for "make check" to test most of the major functionality in
   the library
 - made qthread_fork() (and related functions) significantly faster if called
   from within a qthread by making it possible to avoid using mutexes to
   protect memory pools
 - qthread_shep() may now take a NULL if you don't have a qthread_t handy
   (qthread_shep(NULL) is faster than qthread_shep(qthread_self()))

Bug fixes:
 - corrected the behavior of qthread_readFF() and readFE() (they were
   dereferencing things too many times)
 - qthread_unlock() will now function correctly if unlocking something that's
   already unlocked (it could get into a deadlock situation before, because it
   wasn't cleaning up after itself)
 - fixed a typo in qalloc_dynmalloc() that could cause deadlock on some
   architectures
 - corrected memory pooling to eliminate assertion failures
