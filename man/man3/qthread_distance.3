.SH NAME
\fBqthread_distance\fR \- returns the qthread's shepherd ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread/qthread.h>

.I int
.br
\fBqthread_distance\fR(const qthread_shepherd_id_t \fIsrc\fR, const qthread_shepherd_id_t \fIdest\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns the distance from the \fIsrc\fR shepherd to the memory of the \fIdest\fR shepherd. The distances are arbitrary, and may not exactly measure latency to memory, but do give an indication of relative distance. Shepherds that do not have a specific CPU affinity can be anywhere, and so the distance from or to such shepherds is considered 0.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
This function either returns the distance between the two specified shepherds, or returns QTHREAD_BADARGS if a shepherd identifier is invalid.
