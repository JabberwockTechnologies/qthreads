2006-11-16 17:03  kbwheel

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, test.c, test2.c, test3.c, testq.c:
	  implemented "make check"

2006-11-16 17:03  kbwheel

	* qalloc.c: fixed an idiotic locking error in dynmalloc() (note to
	  self: theres only one bitmap, not one per stream)

2006-11-16 13:54  kbwheel

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, configure.in: bumped the
	  version to be more release-oriented ;)

2006-11-16 13:53  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: created the prepare() and run() functions
	  for Megan

2006-11-16 12:59  kbwheel

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in, configure,
	  qthread.c: some speed improvements, decoupled asserts and
	  debugging

2006-11-15 18:19  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: removed extraneous arguments to atomic functions

2006-11-15 18:14  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: removed extraneous memory references in other queue
	  operations

2006-11-15 18:04  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: removed extraneous memory references in nonblocking dq

2006-11-15 17:55  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: fixing a major problem in unlocking things that were
	  never locked in the first place (would lock the hashtable and
	  never unlock it)

2006-11-15 17:54  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: speeding up all the locks

2006-11-13 14:03  kbwheel

	* README: PGI comments

2006-11-13 13:51  kbwheel

	* qalloc.c, qthread.c: gcc -pedantic warnings eliminated for c99

2006-11-13 13:45  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: corrected qthread_readFF and qthread_readFE

2006-11-13 13:45  kbwheel

2006-11-07 18:21  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: oops, Im an idiot

2006-11-07 12:53  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: a correction for the end of the qthread_wrapper

2006-11-07 12:48  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: more memory efficiency for delayed joins (does this
	  actually affect many things? I doubt it, but you never know, and
	  it doesnt hurt anything)

2006-11-07 12:41  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: fix pgCC compile errors (one warning remains, because
	  C++ structs are really classes)

2006-11-06 19:03  kbwheel

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: this api is definitely binary
	  incompatible with the previous

2006-11-06 19:02  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: made many things const, to help with optimization.
	  also changed the locking "sub" helpers to be detached (as they
	  should be)

2006-11-06 19:01  kbwheel

	* qthread.h: made many things const to help with optimization

2006-11-06 18:16  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: added qthread_shep() to find out my current
	  shepherd id

2006-11-06 18:01  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: more helpful comments, and moved WORDSIZE
	  to the .h file

2006-11-06 17:55  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: added the ability to proxy FEB locking
	  commands

2006-11-06 17:18  kbwheel

	* qthread.h: corrected the comments

2006-11-06 17:12  kbwheel

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config.h.in, configure, configure.in,
	  qthread.c, qthread.h, test3.c: 64-bit safe, works with new FEB
	  locking semantics

2006-11-06 13:34  kbwheel

	* test.c, test3.c: because qthread_lock and _unlock now function,
	  now I can use qthread_join() directly, and avoid nonsense that I
	  had previously had to go through to wait for things to finish.

2006-11-06 13:34  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: qthread_lock and _unlock now will function
	  correctly if passed a NULL thread

2006-11-06 12:16  kbwheel

	* configure, configure.in: correct cprops url

2006-11-06 12:14  kbwheel

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in, configure:
	  updates from the new acinclude and configure.in

2006-11-06 12:09  kbwheel

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in: need stdint... would like to have
	  inttypes, but...

2006-11-06 12:07  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: fixed struct rlimit on non-gcc compilers

2006-11-06 12:06  kbwheel

	* README: PGI compilation notes

2006-11-06 12:05  kbwheel

	* qalloc.c, qalloc.h: PGI compilation fixes (i.e. portability) and
	  made it usable by C++ applications

2006-11-06 11:20  kbwheel

	* qthread.h: better descriptions

2006-11-06 11:17  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: pooling is fixed again. realized that addrres's were
	  being fed to other thread's pools, which will obviously cause
	  problems in unsynch'd pools. However, what this does is puts
	  memory back in a pool that it did not come from. This *shouldn't*
	  be a problem, because the size is right, but I mention it because
	  you never know.

2006-11-03 19:07  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: spacing

2006-11-03 19:03  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: pooling is broken again... not sure why. trimmed the
	  critical section in FEB table removal (unnecessary, but then, why
	  not?)

2006-11-03 17:17  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: dont have private int file yet

2006-11-03 17:16  kbwheel

	* qthread.h: correct semantics

2006-11-03 17:15  kbwheel

	* qthread.h: play nicely with C++

2006-11-03 17:13  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: comments, many compilation fixes for non-gcc compilers
	  (not all finished), and some semantic fixes for the readFE/readFF
	  functions

2006-11-03 14:21  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: explain double-casting

2006-11-03 14:21  kbwheel

	* test2.c: none of that memwatch stuff

2006-11-03 12:20  kbwheel

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: removing CVS files is a little much

2006-11-03 10:22  kbwheel

	* qthread.h: qthread_self support

2006-11-03 10:22  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: qthread_self support (theres got to be a faster way)

2006-11-01 15:19  kbwheel

	* qalloc.c: better compatability and warning messages

2006-10-31 19:13  kbwheel

	* 386-ucontext.h, COPYRIGHT, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4,
	  asm.S, config.h.in, configure, configure.in, context.c,
	  mkinstalldirs, power-ucontext.h, taskimpl.h: it now works on OSX
	  as well as linux and solaris -- pulled in parts from libtask (by
	  Russ Cox)

2006-10-31 19:12  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: works with the portable makecontext stuff, also
	  cleaned up the code some

2006-10-31 14:40  rcmurph

	* AUTHORS: updated names/affiliations

2006-10-31 12:36  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: no, on some architectures (dunno which ones) this
	  getcontext is required (it is used by most other similar
	  coroutine libraries)

2006-10-31 12:35  kbwheel

	* README: accuracy and completeness

2006-10-31 12:27  kbwheel

	* qalloc.c: folding markers

2006-10-31 12:27  kbwheel

	* qalloc.h: comments

2006-10-30 18:14  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: did not need the extraneous getcontext

2006-10-30 18:06  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: ooops, left debugging #include in there

2006-10-30 15:17  kbwheel

	* testq.c: dynmap

2006-10-30 15:17  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: per-pthread memory pooling eliminates a bunch of
	  unnecessary locking (some still needed)

2006-10-30 13:44  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: pooling stacks and contexts now. also assigning
	  shepherd ID much earlier (preparing for per-shepherd pools)

2006-10-26 13:44  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, test2.c: the pooling seems a bit better now...

2006-10-26 10:16  kbwheel

	* qalloc.c, qalloc.h: added the dynamically-sized stuff

2006-10-26 10:16  kbwheel

	  configure, configure.in: added qalloc

2006-10-26 10:15  kbwheel

	* test3.c: test detached threads

2006-10-26 10:14  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: Added detached threads (i.e. threads that
	  clean up after themselves when they exit), and made it possible
	  to toggle mempooling on and off (currently, mempools seem to be
	  broken when compiled for 64-bit architectures).

2006-10-18 17:13  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: minor touches

2006-10-18 17:13  kbwheel

	* qalloc.c, qalloc.h, testq.c: not tied to the qthreads library
	  yet, but interesting and useful

2006-10-17 13:35  kbwheel

	* qthread.c: oops - extraneous debugging code

2006-10-17 13:34  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: full FEB support is now functionally
	  complete. also, unlocking unlocked memory wont cause the program
	  to abort anymore.

2006-10-16 11:28  kbwheel

	* config.h.in: [no log message]

2006-10-16 11:28  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: beginning of full FEB support

2006-10-11 19:06  kbwheel

	  test2.c: minor fixes, accessor functions

2006-10-11 17:35  kbwheel

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: moved internal functions out of the public
	  header file, did a little reformatting

	* configure, configure.in: better error messages

2006-10-11 12:44  kbwheel

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.in: OSX does not have
	  get/set/swapcontext, so should detect that and complain bitterly

2006-10-11 12:39  kbwheel

	* COPYING, INSTALL, config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, install-sh,
	  ltmain.sh, missing: all the automake files
